    Constructs a Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone.

    Reference: `"Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with
    Region Proposal Networks" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497>`_.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape ``[C, H, W]``, one for each
    image, and should be in ``0-1`` range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:

        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (``Int64Tensor[N]``): the class label for each ground-truth box

    The model returns a ``Dict[Tensor]`` during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a ``List[Dict[Tensor]]``, one for each input image. The fields of the ``Dict`` are as
    follows, where ``N`` is the number of detections:

        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (``Int64Tensor[N]``): the predicted labels for each detection
        - scores (``Tensor[N]``): the scores of each detection

    For more details on the output, you may refer to :ref:`instance_seg_output`.

    Faster R-CNN is exportable to ONNX for a fixed batch size with inputs images of fixed size.
