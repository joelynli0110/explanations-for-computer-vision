# Explanations for Computer Vision

This project is the final submission of the project 'Explanation for Computer vision' in which we apply explanation techniques LIME and RISE for object detection.  In order to see the demo of this project, you need to run *check_explanations_coco.ipynb* . 
Before running the notebook we need to download the coco dataset.

## Downolading the COCO Dataset
Download the COCO dataset from [here](https://cocodataset.org/#download)
In order to only test the notebook with out training the object detector on COCO dataset just download **[2017 Train/Val annotations [241MB]](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip) and [2017 Val images [5K/1GB]](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip).  Copy these file inside the **coco** folder.
